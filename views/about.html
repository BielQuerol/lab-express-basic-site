    <h2>About</h2>
    <article>Alfredo James "Al" 'Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema's most vibrant decades,
      the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.

      He was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal
      Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx.
      Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and
      unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career.
      Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to
      succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator
      of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.

      After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel
      Horovitz's "The Indian Wants the Bronx", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony
      Award for "Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic
      stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in Pánico en Needle Park (1971) after his film
      debut in Yo, Natalia (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in El padrino (1972) was one of the most sought-after of
      the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors
      either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.

      Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot.
      The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
      However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support
      behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the
      tragic real-life bank robbery film Tarde de perros (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the "Best
      Actor" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Un instante, una vida (1977), but regained his stride with
      Justicia para todos (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately,
      this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like A la caza (1980) and Autor,
      autor (1982).

      Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film El
      precio del poder (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolución (1985) endured an endless and
      seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia.
      Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among
      the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years.
      Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first
      love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile
      with the striking Melodía de seducción (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of
      Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.

      Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made El padrino: Parte III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role
      in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting
      Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross: Éxito a cualquier precio (1992). He went into
      romantic mode for Frankie y Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his
      amazing performance in Esencia de mujer (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and
      charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.

      The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out
      great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days.
      Atrapado por su pasado (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by
      Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Looking for Richard
      (1996). During this period, City Hall: La sombra de la corrupción (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Pactar con el
      diablo (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in El
      dilema (1999) and Un domingo cualquiera (1999).

      In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean's 13 (2007), but his choice
      in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his
      sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie No conoces a Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the
      bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor
      in a Miniseries or a Movie.</article>
